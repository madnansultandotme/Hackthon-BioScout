"The Margalla Hills National Park is home to over 600 plant species, 250 bird species, 38 mammals, and 13 species of reptiles, making it one of the most biodiverse regions in Pakistan. The park's elevation ranges from 685m to 1,604m, creating diverse microhabitats that support this rich biodiversity."
"The Common Leopard (Panthera pardus) is occasionally sighted in the Margalla Hills, especially near Rawal Lake and the higher forested areas. These sightings are rare and often reported by hikers and park rangers. The leopards are known to prey on wild boar, barking deer, and other small mammals that inhabit the hills."
"Margalla Hills are a key habitat for the Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus), which can often be seen displaying its colorful plumage during the breeding season in spring. The hills provide ideal conditions with mixed forest cover, water sources, and open areas for display."
"The Rawal Lake area supports a variety of waterfowl and migratory birds, including the Ruddy Shelduck and Common Teal, especially during the winter months. The lake's wetlands and surrounding vegetation create an important stopover point for migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway."
"The Margalla Hills ecosystem faces threats from urbanization, illegal logging, and forest fires, which impact both flora and fauna. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique natural heritage, including community-based monitoring programs and habitat restoration initiatives."
"The Shakarparian area, adjacent to Margalla Hills, hosts a unique mix of urban and natural habitats. This transition zone supports species like the Rose-ringed Parakeet and House Crow, which have adapted well to urban environments while maintaining connections to natural habitats."
"Rawal Lake's aquatic ecosystem supports diverse fish species and provides critical habitat for resident and migratory waterbirds. The lake's water quality and surrounding vegetation are carefully managed to maintain this important biodiversity hotspot."
"The F-8 and F-9 parks in Islamabad serve as important urban biodiversity refuges, supporting various bird species including the House Sparrow, Common Myna, and various warblers. These green spaces are crucial for maintaining urban biodiversity and providing ecosystem services."
"Margalla Hills' forest types include subtropical pine, subtropical broadleaf, and tropical thorn forests. This diverse forest composition supports a wide range of bird species, from canopy-dwelling parakeets to ground-foraging bulbuls and thrushes."
"The seasonal variations in Margalla Hills create distinct ecological patterns. Spring brings breeding activities for resident birds, summer supports diverse insect populations, autumn sees the arrival of migratory species, and winter hosts various waterfowl at Rawal Lake."
